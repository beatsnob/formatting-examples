this is how you highlight `code .` in a sentence 

```py
adding a triple backtick is how you embed a block of code within the text, such as 

def hello():
    print("Hello") 

adding "py" (or whatever language the code is written in) just after the opening backticks will colour the syntax for that language

```

you can also add a numbered list by

1. adding the numbers
2. on separate lines

and also add a bulleted list by

- using hyphens
- to add the bullets

you can add a link by putting the linked text in [square brackets](www.github.com) and the actual link in brackets directly next to it
